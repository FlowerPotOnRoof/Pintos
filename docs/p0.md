## Debugging

#### QUESTIONS: BIOS 

>B1: What is the first instruction that gets executed?

`ljmp   $0x3630,$0xf000e05b`

>B2: At which physical address is this instruction located?

`0xffff0`
`This address is located in BIOS zone of RAM`

#### QUESTIONS: BOOTLOADER

>B3: How does the bootloader read disk sectors? In particular, what BIOS interrupt is used?

First prepare some parameters such LBA, buffer address, number of sectors to read, etc., then call BIOS interrupt 0x13 to load sectors into memory.

>B4: How does the bootloader decides whether it successfully finds the Pintos kernel?

The 1 byte long type info starts from 04H in [[MBR]] partition item,
and when it is 0x20 we find pintos kernel.

>B5: What happens when the bootloader could not find the Pintos kernel?

Issue interrupt `0x18` to tell BIOS that boot failed.

>B6: At what point and how exactly does the bootloader transfer control to the Pintos kernel?

Loader begins to transfer control when all sectors of kernel have been loaded.
More specifically, it starts after `loop next_sector` condition is false, while `cx` records the remaining number of sectors to read.
```
next_sector:
	# Read one sector into memory.
	mov %ax, %es			# ES:0000 -> load address
	call read_sector
	jc read_failed

	# Print '.' as progress indicator once every 16 sectors == 8 kB.
	test $15, %bl
	jnz 1f
	call puts
	.string "."
1:

	# Advance memory pointer and disk sector.
	add $0x20, %ax
	inc %bx
	loop next_sector
```

80x86 doesn't have a way to directly jump to an absolute segment:offset([[8086分段式寻址]]), so we have to store it temporarily in memory. As you can see, offset of kernel's entry stored in `%es:0x18` is cpoied to `start`, and segment value `0x2000` to `start + 2`. Consequently, bootloader will transfer control to kernel entry located in `0x2000*16 + offset` by `ljmp *start`.
```
	mov $0x2000, %ax
	mov %ax, %es
	mov %es:0x18, %dx
	mov %dx, start
	movw $0x2000, start + 2
	ljmp *start
```
#### QUESTIONS: KERNEL

>B7: At the entry of pintos_init(), what is the value of expression `init_page_dir[pd_no(ptov(0))]` in hexadecimal format?

0x0

>B8: When `palloc_get_page()` is called for the first time,

>> B8.1 what does the call stack look like?
>>
>> 
```

## Kernel Monitor

>C1: Put the screenshot of your kernel monitor running example here. (It should show how your kernel shell respond to `whoami`, `exit`, and `other input`.)

>C2: Explain how you read and write to the console for the kernel monitor.

Significantly, pressing `enter` key in Windows sends `\r\n` to console. However, it's weired that I can only capture `\r` in one key press.
